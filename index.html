<h2>Aladdin</h2>
<body>
    <p1>Hi there! I’m Aladdin, just a regular guy from the bustling 
        streets of Agrabah. I may not have a lot of riches, but I’ve got
         a big heart and a knack for adventure. My life took a wild 
         turn when I found a magical lamp and met the Genie, who 
         showed me that sometimes, true treasure comes from being 
         true to yourself. With my best friend Abu by my side and my 
         dreams of a better life, I’m ready to take on whatever 
         challenges come my way—especially if it means winning the 
         heart of Princess Jasmine!</p1>
    </br>
    </br>

</body>
    <p2>This is my best buddy, Abu. He’s not just a monkey; 
        he’s my loyal sidekick and partner in crime! He’s got a
         mischievous streak and loves shiny things, which can sometimes 
         land us in trouble. But no matter what, we always have each 
         other’s backs. Plus, he’s got a big heart and knows how to make
          me laugh, even in the toughest situations!"</p2>
